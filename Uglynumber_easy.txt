QUESTION 236 

UGLY NUMBER (EASY )

An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.

Given an integer n, return true if n is an ugly number.

 

Example 1:

Input: n = 6
Output: true
Explanation: 6 = 2 Ã— 3
Example 2:

Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: 1 has no prime factors, therefore all of its prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5.
Example 3:

Input: n = 14
Output: false
Explanation: 14 is not ugly since it includes the prime factor 7.
 

Constraints:

-231 <= n <= 231 - 1


SOLUTION :>
 
DESCRIPTION	->This code first checks if n is less than or equal to 0, in which case it returns false because negative numbers and 0 are not considered ugly numbers. Then, it repeatedly divides n by 2, 3, and 5 as long as n is divisible by these numbers. If n becomes 1 after these divisions, the function returns true, indicating that n is an ugly number. If n is not 1 after these divisions, it means n has a prime factor other than 2, 3, or 5, and the function returns false.

This solution is efficient and meets the requirement of using constant extra space, as it only uses a few variables and does not require any additional data structures.




#CODE 
class Solution {
    public boolean isUgly(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return false;
        }
        else if(n==1)
        {
            return true;
        }
        
        while (n % 2 == 0) {
            n /= 2;
        }
        while (n % 3 == 0) {
            n /= 3;
        }
        while (n % 5 == 0) {
            n /= 5;
        }
        
        return n == 1;
    }
}
